			<td>It was Todd Durham that directed the movie. The movie was released on Sept 28, 2012 on all theaters in the Philippines</td>
			<td>At Count Dracula's Hotel Transylvania, an opulent resort where they can be themselves without people around to worry them, monsters travel to get away from it all. Dracula invites the Mummy, the Invisible Man, and other creatures to a special weekend celebration of his daughter Mavis's 118th birthday (Selena Gomez). Unexpected complications arise when a regular person unintentionally crashes the party and falls in love with Mavis.</td>

			<td>Hotel Transylvania 2</td>
			<td>The movie was directed by Genndy Tartakovsky. The movie was publicly released on September 23, 2015 on all theaters in the Philippines.</td>
			<td>Things are better now that Dracula has welcomed humanity into the Hotel Transylvania, but Drac is privately concerned that his half-human grandson, Dennis, isn't displaying his vampire side. Thus, Drac recruits his cronies to assist him in putting the youngster through a "monster-in-training" boot camp while Mavis and Johnny are abroad. But when Drac's cranky, traditional father (Mel Brooks) pays a surprise visit, things really spiral out of control.</td>

			<td>Hotel Transylvania 3</td>
			<td>This was released on August 29, 2018. It was still made by Genndy Tartakovsky.</td>
			<td>So that Dracula may spend the summer away from the hotel, the monster clan embarks on a lavish cruise ship. The group enjoys the various activities the cruise has to offer, such as monster volleyball, exotic excursions, and getting some much-needed moon tanner as they cruise around. When Mavis learns that Drac has developed feelings for the enigmatic ship's captain, Ericka, who is hiding a terrible secret that could end them all, the ideal vacation quickly turns into a nightmare.</td>
